        <h2>Free Software</h2>
        <p>Free Software is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre">free as in speech, not free as in beer</a>. We believe that the software that builds the backbone of smart homes must not be closed or restricted, but that everybody must have the freedom to modify and enhance it. We therefore fully support and help to spread the ideal of Free software as proclaimed by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.</p>

        <h2>Smart Home</h2>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Automation">Smart Homes</a> are our passion - and therefore we strive to make its benefits better known to the public and also to educate people about associated problems and risks. We specifically believe that smart homes must not mandatorily depend on cloud services, but should work offline as well. This not only assures the independency from the internet, but also addresses data privacy concerns.</p>
