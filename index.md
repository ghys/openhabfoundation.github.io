<h1 class="welcome">Welcome to the openHAB Foundation!</h1>

We are a nonprofit organisation with the mission to educate the public about the possibilities and benefits of free and open smart home solutions.

More and more new technologies and devices are introduced to our living, working and business environment. Although all of them are designed to make our lives easier, they have a common problem: The lack of interoperability, due to incompatible technology stacks and conflicting commercial interests. Market consolidation and cooperation between all stakeholders therefore remains a vision.

System-wide, multi-vendor interoperability can only succeed if it is free from monetary interests. Free Software is the best option to boost innovation and to make smart home technology available for everybody. Furthermore, Free Software is irreplaceable for research and teaching.

<h2 class="big-title">Our Focus</h2>

<div class="features">

<div class="feature">
<h2>Free Software</h2>
<p>Free Software is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre">free as in speech, not free as in beer</a>. We believe that the software that builds the backbone of smart homes must not be closed or restricted, but that everybody must have the freedom to modify and enhance it. We therefore fully support and help to spread the ideal of Free software as proclaimed by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.</p>

<div class="feature">
<h2>Smart Home</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Automation">Smart Homes</a> are our passion - and therefore we strive to make its benefits better known to the public and also to educate people about associated problems and risks. We specifically believe that smart homes must not mandatorily depend on cloud services, but should work offline as well. This not only assures the independency from the internet, but also addresses data privacy concerns.</p>

<h2>openHAB</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.openhab.org">openHAB</a> is one of the most popular open source software solutions for smart homes. It leaves full control and utmost flexibility to the user and is able to serve as an integration point for most smart home products on the market.
